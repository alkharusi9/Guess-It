# Guess-Number
This python program is like a game, it will ask the user 3 different ranges to choose from. Once the user chooses a range it will ask the user to try to guess the right number that was given randomly by the code, it will give the user 3 chances to try, if none is valid then the user will be locked out and says 3 attempts failed, if any guess is correct then it will says something like "well done, your guess is correct". I wrote this code just for fun, and I hope it could be useful some how for anyone. There are 2 verions, first one is long, second one is shorter and simpler, you are free to choose.This is just the first the version of the code and more updates shall came soon.
