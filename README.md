# Guess-Number
This python program is like a game, it will ask the user to enter two numbers, these two numbers will be a range. Once the user chooses a range it will ask the user to try to guess the right number that was chosen randomly by the code inside that range, it will give the user 3 chances to try, if none is valid then the user will be locked out and says 3 attempts failed, if any guess is correct then it will says something like "well done, your guess is correct". I wrote this code just for fun, and I hope it could be useful some how for anyone. This is just the first the version of the code and more updates probably will came soon.
